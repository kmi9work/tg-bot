  base_url: http://127.0.0.1/sugarcrm # where your SugarCRM instance is located

  # connection pool settings
  # if you don't know what purpose this serves, you can safely ignore these settings
  # works similarly to Rails' database connection pooling (documented here: http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/ConnectionAdapters/ConnectionPool.html)
#   pool: 3 # the maximum number of simulatenous connections the gem should open with the SugarCRM server (default is 5)
#   wait_timeout: 7 # maximum time to wait for an available connection to SugarCRM server, in seconds (default is 5)
